Channel: G603BJAQN User:U60621XM2 - From what I understand you need to have the AntShare node running in order to be part of the PoS consensus to earn ANC correct?
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5WDWN9GT - any tips for keeping identity secure when committing to public repos? I'm not too comfortable with my real name and email address being linked to projects involving lots of money and hackers.

Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5ZKNEB3N - What’s happening with ANS now reminds me of doge in 2013 .. Chinese whales heavily manipulated the market with PnD. Don’t even bother trying to time the market, because it won’t work.
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5ZE9V1S9 - People, if i wanted to create a 'paper wallet', would that just mean writing down my private key/usrnme+passsord then just deleting wallet?

Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - you could download a markdown ide and edit locally?
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5YNDLZ4H - I'm editing the files locally but I would like to be able to test their functionality before creating a new commit, since this mainly revolves around GitHub markdown I'm not sure how to test it without committing the changes to my Fork which then when I submit a pull request I just seems that there's the possibility commits won't even do anything because another commit right after it fixed the problem that the other one didn't does that make sense?

Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - have you made any progress there?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - Guys I have question as much more devs start to buils on eth or neo? Does this affect the price of the share going up too? Or it has nothing to do with it?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5BBD0ALS - if its never gonna dip then whats the issue?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - You mean we buy now and share our neos? And split the price?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - Everyday on different price levels?
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - the other thing i was thinking (no way this can scale, right?) is that the web wallet might download info for literally every block
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - which has the same log in before execute thing on the node
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5ZFXKXD0 - perhaps the web wallet app is itself a node?
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - hmm, so web wallet contains a full node implementation? that seems unlikely to me, but maybe
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - when i look at outgoing requests in chrome dev tools, everything is swamped by “getblockcount” requests (it sends thousands of them), will see if I can find a way to clean those out and inspect more thoroughly later

Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5WU1B1M5 - What page?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5WU1B1M5 - How many people are still just using the exchanges
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5WU1B1M5 - Unless that is also captured?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5XMK6DHB - very good point - do exchanges count as one big wallet, though? I think they must create a "wallet" for each individual holder, if we've got independent addresses
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - But guys how are you doing this right now?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - Is 1 ans
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5TU76U4T - but if so, how is the web wallet sending anything? :stuck_out_tongue:
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5YNDLZ4H - I mean the code really only allows for on variable and its the hex of a "signed transaction", signed pretty much means broadcast and soon to be or already mined? Somebody correct me if i got this wrong
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5YNDLZ4H - sendtransaction has the sending code doesnt it?
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5YNDLZ4H - asset manager? Wallet?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5VAD50CV - Anyone know Status ico price?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5XMK6DHB - I assume that must be true, but it makes you wonder why other exchanges haven't jumped on the opportunity to do the same, right?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5ZKNEB3N - If it goes into more exchanges, wouldn't it get dumped on instead?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5ZNMH81G - Can you have 2 portfolios in blockfolio?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - can someone explain the strategy behind this?

Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - ever seen a chart like this?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5WDHP0UW - Who knows when ans first got big they bought it for days str8
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5ZKNEB3N - At $300, what's the market cap going to be? I wonder
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5ZKNEB3N - I mean, would the current code structure allows for that?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - I also like storj do you know it?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5WT5UTJL - You guys think synereo will have a good couple of days? With the release of wildspark being the 30th
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5ZKNEB3N - Yes, but that rely on network effect? Unless I'm mistaken.
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - Yes metalpay do you know more about it? how to get a share in it?
Channel: G603BJAQN User:U5ZKNEB3N - Or is it better for me to try doing it as a separate bot?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z2ZN3F0 - why chase litecoin when bitcoin is going to do well :stuck_out_tongue:

Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5VJARQG0 - u think guys they gonna make it dip tn?
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5WUX5AH2 - Whoever bought at that range that is
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - When most Westerns will realize the value of NEO they will be too late
Channel: C27HUP45N User:U5Z05SNAG - or they cancelled it?
